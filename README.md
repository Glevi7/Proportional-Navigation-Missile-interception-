# Proportional-Navigation-Missile-interception-
Simulate a interceptor missile using Simulink and Matlab 


 1) Run initialization file (Missile) , which can be updated to simulate different conditions

 2) Run simulink simulation (Missile_model ) to define the control and movement of the missile 

 3) Run the graphing code (missilegrapher) in matlab to visualize
