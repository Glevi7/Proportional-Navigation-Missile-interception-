# Proportional-Navigation-Missile-interception-
Simulate a interceptor missile using Simulink and Matlab 


 1) Run initialization file, which can be updated to simulate different conditions

 2) Run simulink simulation to define the control and movement of the missile 

 3) Run the graphing code in matlab to visualize
